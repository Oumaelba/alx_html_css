			<h1>Writing is the key</h1>
			<h2>What is writing?</h2>
			<p>Each one of us has many unsaid ideas, they can't let them out of their mouths; maybe because too hard to say, maybe no one will understand... and it might of many other reasons. some use writing to set these ideas free or their mind will blow.<br> Writing is the land where those unsaid thoughts can run free, free of judment, free of misunderstanding, free of toxicity that may poisn them or <strong>kill</strong> them. That what is Writing.</p>
			<h2>How to write?</h2>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<p>To set your inner soul free, you don't need expensive tools, complicated softwares or immense knowledge. You will only need a pen and paper or a note app. your pen is your sword and your blank paper is your land where you gonna make it pulse and see it revive</p>
			<h3>Location</h3>
			<p>No hotels with inspirational views you will need, neither green spots, youy will only need a space where you feel comfortable; your bedroom maybe, your favourite couch or eve the bathroom(Not recommended), and you wont even stay there, 2 minutes and you will travel inside and the inside will be in your paper. the empty land will shine word by word.</p>
			<h2>Congratulations, you are a writer.</h2>
			<p>You finished writing, you are reading your first draft, it is not that perfect, right? who said it should be perfect! who said it should be astonishing, you wrote it, it should make you proud, you should right the date and after you write your number 100 paper, go back to it, to the first one you have ever wrote, to the starting point of your journey, when was your land empty but youy made it better and better and better with concistency and iscipline. the first day on earth people made fire using rocks, now it is on with one click. Congratulations! You unleashed to wroiter withing you. </p>
